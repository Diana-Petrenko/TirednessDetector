# Tiredness Detection using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project implements a fatigue detection system using **Python** and **OpenCV**. It analyzes live video feed to monitor the user's facial features and detect signs of tiredness. If the system identifies eye closure or yawning, a visual and auditory alert notifies the user, recommending a break.

The main goal is to provide an early warning system to prevent over-exhaustion, which is especially useful in scenarios like long driving sessions, remote work, or virtual meetings.
